# Trade Federation (TF / Tradefed)

TF is a test harness used to drive Android automated testing. It runs on test hosts
and monitors the connected devices, handling test scheduling & execution and device
management.

Other test harnesses like Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and Vendor Test Suite
(VTS) use TF as a basis and extend it for their particular needs.
